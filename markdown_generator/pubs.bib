  abstract = {To solve a challenging issue, i.e., the gap opening of graphene, we designed several heterojunctions of graphene and other two-dimensional carbonitride materials with natural holes in their monolayers, namely, nitrogenated holey graphene (NHG), g-C3N4, and g-CN, to destroy graphene's sublattice symmetry and we investigated their electronic structures by first-principles calculations, in which the external electric field effect was also considered. We found that the heterojunctions, except for that with g-CN, have a direct band gap and that their important band edge states are dominated mainly by their graphene layer. The electric field can open band gaps and reduce the effective mass of electron and hole. The graphene/NHG has a large band gap (186.6 meV) and electron effective mass, which can be reduced from 1.31 to 0.014 m0 by applying an electric field of 0.4 V/{\AA}. The NHG/graphene/NHG has the largest band gap of 250.7 meV among all of the graphene-based heterojunctions. The band gap of g-C3N4/graphene/g-C3N4 can be enlarged from 76.8 to 85.5 meV by applying a perpendicular electric field (0.6 V/{\AA}). Interestingly, the external electric field can also convert the indirect band gap of graphene/g-CN into a direct one of 83.3 meV. Our results are useful for fast graphene-based nano-optoelectronic devices.},

Three important results are obtained. First, as donor dopants, the activation energies (ED) of CB, SN and SiB are 1.22, 0.50 and 0.86 eV, respectively. The ED of Si can be further reduced via Si--nO codoping with an increasing O-atom number and it decreases to 0.39 eV for Si--3O. Second, ED can be effectively reduced by applying strain. The Si--3O has the lowest activation energy of 0.06 eV under 4\% compressive biaxial strain. Finally, there is an obvious charge transfer from adsorbed AM atoms to h-BN monolayers, which results in an enhancement of electron concentration and improvement of n-type conductivity. This charge transfer is insensitive to the strain. The present results are significant for improving the performance of h-BN based two-dimensional optoelectronic nanodevices.},

Our results show that the band gap of the AlN NW with 1 nm diameter is 8.40 eV due to the strong one-dimensional quantum confinement, which is larger than that of AlN bulk (6.2 eV). The exciton binding energy is 1.75 eV owing to incomplete dielectric screening in AlN NWs. The defects including N vacancy (VN), Al vacancy (VAl), O impurity (ON), and 3ON--VAl have low formation energy and prefer to stay at the surface layer of AlN NWs. It is the combination of the optical transitions from the exciton ground state to these defect levels that determines the wide and asymmetric BL band in AlN NWs. Our work is useful for understanding the defect-related luminescence mechanism and improving the performance of AlN NW-based optoelectronic nanodevices.},

  abstract = {AlN nanotubes (NTs) have many novel characteristics and great potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic nanodevices. However, little is known about the influence of Mg-O co-doping effects on their optical properties. Here, we focus on investigating the electronic structures, clarify the interband optical transition mechanism and give a clear atomic picture for the important electron/hole localization centre in AlN:Mg-O NTs using the GGA-1/2 method. We find that the Mg doping efficiency can be improved effectively due to O doping in AlN NTs. The Mg and O form Mg-O defect complex easily along the AlN NT axis (C-axis). The Mg-O defect complex can result in a remarkable charge transfer around it and modify the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum significantly. Meanwhile, the Mg-O defect complex also forms the important exciton localization centre and effectively enhances the interband radiative recombination rate. Moreover, the light emission/absorption sensitively depends on its polarization. The parallel polarized light () is much stronger than the perpendicular one (). The Mg-O co-doping thus paves a new way for improving the performance of electronic and optoelectronic nanodevices based on AlN NTs.},

Here, we solve these two notable issues by using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory combined with polarization-resolved experiments. We demonstrate that the ubiquitous surface ``microwires'' with amazing characteristics, i.e., the outgrowth nanocrystal along the NW side wall, are vital and offer a new perspective to provide insight into some puzzles in epitaxy materials. Furthermore, inversion of the top valence bands, in the decreasing order of crystal-field split-off hole (CH) and heavy/light hole, results in the optical transition polarized along the NW axis due to quantum confinement. The optical emission from bound excitons localized around the surface microwire to CH band is responsible for the 3.45 eV line with E{$\parallel$}c polarization. Both gallium vacancy and carbon-related defects tend to assemble at the NW surface layer, determining the broadening YL band.},

The formation energy is the lowest for NX or AgZn in the ZnX layer. The Zn-rich (Zn-poor) condition is favourable for the formation of the NX (AgZn) defect. Compensation by the native defects can be avoided for the Ag-doped (ZnO)m/(ZnX)n under the Zn-poor condition. The N (Ag) acceptor activation energy can be reduced from 0.45 (0.43) eV in ZnO to 0.33 (0.32) eV in (ZnO)5/(ZnS)1, 0.20 (0.24) eV in (ZnO)5/(ZnSe)1 and 0.12 (0.13) eV in (ZnO)5/(ZnTe)1, which is caused by the ZnX-monolayer modulation to the local structure around the NX or AgZn defect and the high-lying p-derived valence bands. Moreover, the band gaps can be tuned from 3.40 eV of ZnO to 3.21 eV of (ZnO)5/(ZnS)1, 2.41 eV of (ZnO)5/(ZnSe)1 and 2.26 eV of (ZnO)5/(ZnTe)1, which is promising for the integration of ZnO-based white light-emitting diodes.},

  abstract = {The problem of achieving high light extraction efficiency in Al-rich AlxGaN is of paramount importance for the realization of AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet (DUV) optoelectronic devices. To solve this problem, we investigate the microscopic mechanism of valence band inversion and light polarization, a crucial factor for enhancing light extraction efficiency, in Al-rich AlxGaN alloy using the Heyd--Scuseria--Ernzerhof hybrid functional, local-density approximation with 1/2 occupation, and the Perdew--Burke--Ernzerhof functional, in which the spin--orbit coupling effect is included. We find that the microscopic Ga-atom distribution can effectively modulate the valence band structure of Al-rich AlxGaN. Moreover, we prove that the valence band arrangement in the decreasing order of heavy hole, light hole, and crystal-field split-off hole can be realized by using nanoscale (AlN)m/(GaN)n (m{$>$}n) superlattice (SL) substituting for Al-rich AlxGaN disorder alloy as the active layer of optoelectronic devices due to the ultra-thin GaN layer modulation. The valence band maximum, i.e., the heavy hole band, has px- and py-like characteristics and is highly localized in the SL structure, which leads to the desired transverse electric (TE) polarized (E{$\perp$}c) light emission with improved light extraction efficiency in the DUV spectral region. Some important band-structure parameters and electron/hole effective masses are also given. The physical origin for the valence band inversion and TE polarization in (AlN)m/(GaN)n SL is analyzed in depth.},

Although some basic quantum properties of SPPs, such as the preservation of entanglement, the wave-particle duality of a single plasmon, the quantum interference of two plasmons, and the verification of entanglement generation, have been shown, more advanced quantum information protocols have yet to be demonstrated with SPPs. Here, we experimentally realize quantum state teleportation between single photons and SPPs. To achieve this, we use polarization-entangled photon pairs, coherent photon--plasmon--photon conversion on a metallic subwavelength hole array, complete Bell-state measurements and an active feed-forward technique. The results of both quantum state and quantum process tomography confirm the quantum nature of the SPP mediated teleportation. An average state fidelity of \$\$0.889{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$\$0.889{\textpm}0.004 and a process fidelity of \$\$0.820{\textbackslash}pm 0.005\$\$0.820{\textpm}0.005, which are well above the classical limit, are achieved.

  abstract = {Common sense suggests that a particle must have a definite origin if its full path information is available. In quantum mechanics, the knowledge of path information is captured through the well-established duality relation between path distinguishability and interference visibility. If visibility is zero, a high path distinguishability can be obtained, which enables one with high predictive power to know where the particle comes from. Here we show that this perception of path information is problematic. We demonstrate the simultaneous observation of zero interference visibility and the complete absence of which-path information using a three-crystal interference setup. With a contradictory argument by grouping the crystals in different ways, we show that it is impossible to ascribe a definite physical origin to the photon pair even if the emission probability of one individual source is zero and full path information is available. Our findings shed new light on the physical interpretation of probability assignment and path information beyond its mathematical meaning and reshape our understanding of the whole and part in the context of distinguishability.},

In order to give an atomic level understanding, we investigate the electronic structures of the wurtziteGa-rich InGaN NWs with different In distributions using first-principles calculations. We find that the In-atoms are apt to distribute on the surface of the NWs and the short surface In-N chains can be easily formed. For the unsaturated NWs, several new bands are induced by the surface states, which can be modified by the surface In microstructures. The randomly formed surface In-N chains can highly localize the electrons/holes at the band edges and dominate the interband optical transition. For the saturated NWs, the band edges are determined by the inner atoms. Our work is useful to improve the performance of the InGaN NW-based optoelectronic devices.},

Integrated quantum devices have recently emerged as a promising platform for creating, processing, and detecting complex high-dimensional entangled states. A crucial step toward practical quantum technologies is to verify that these devices work reliably with an optimal strategy. In this work, we experimentally implement an optimal quantum verification strategy on a three-dimensional maximally entangled state using local projective measurements on a silicon photonic chip. A 95\% confidence is achieved from 1190 copies to verify the target quantum state. The obtained scaling of infidelity as a function of the number of copies is -0.5497 {\textpm} 0.0002, exceeding the standard quantum limit of -0.5 with 248 standard deviations. Our results indicate that quantum state verification could serve as an efficient tool for complex quantum measurement tasks.},

We find that the N-atom bonded with Ga-atom is more easily substituted by O-atom and nMgGa-ON (n = 1-3) complexes are favorable and stable in the SL. The O-atom plays a dominant role in reducing EA. The shorter the Mg-O bond is, the smaller the EA is. The Mg-acceptor activation energy can be reduced significantly by nMgGa-ON\hphantom{,}{$\delta$}-codoping. Our calculated EA for 2MgGa-ON is 0.21 eV, and can be further reduced to 0.13 eV for 3MgGa-ON, which results in a high hole concentration in the order of 1020 cm-3 at room temperature in (AlN)5/(GaN)1 SL. Our results prove that nMgGa-ON (n = 2,3) {$\delta$}-codoping in AlN/GaN SL with ultrathin GaN-layer is an effective way to improve p-type doping efficiency in Al-rich AlGaN.},
